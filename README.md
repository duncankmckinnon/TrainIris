# TrainIris
A shiny app that shows how different learning models perform on the Iris dataset. 
Currently can run logistic regression, 2-layer NN, and Deep NN on the Iris dataset where the species of the flower is an integer [1,2,3].  This isn't the most mathematically satisfying representation (why should the difference between species have magnitude?), but it does exhibit some interesting behavior.
Next steps:
- add other built-in datasets
- set it up to run on any user dataset
- add more models to testing
- handling for unstructured dataset (?)
- options for regularization/hyperparameter optimization (?)
